 {It is commonly believed that multipath hurts various audio process-ing algorithms. 
  At odds with this belief, we show that multipath infact helps sound source separation, 
  even with very simple propagation models.
  Unlike most existing methods, we neither ignore theroom impulse responses, nor we attempt to estimate them fully.
  Werather  assume  that  we  know  the  positions  of  a  few  virtual  micro-phones generated 
  by echoes and we show how this gives us enoughspatial diversity to get a performance boost over the anechoic case.
  We show improvements for two standard algorithmsâ€”one that usesonly magnitudes of the transfer functions, and one that also uses thephases.
  Concretely, we show that multichannel non-negative matrixfactorization aided with a small number of echoes beats the vanillavariant of the same algorithm, and that with magnitude informationonly, echoes enable separation where it was previously impossible},
